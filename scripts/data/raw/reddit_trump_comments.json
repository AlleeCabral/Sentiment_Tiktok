Take state-owned assets and other public goods that are not profitable, and sell them off to private owners. That's what happened to state run industries and housing and healthcare and land and pretty much everything in Russia in the 90s, and the result was absolutely catastrophic because of how quickly and rapaciously it happened. People went from having a state-provided apartment for nearly free + a guaranteed job at a state factory + guaranteed free education and healthcare to having none of that, all at once. Sure, the goods and services they had were fairly crappy, but they were stable and guaranteed. In post-USSR Russia, suddenly a very small portion of the population could have very nice versions of all those things, and everyone else got turned out and got nothing at all. Male life expectancy dropped from like 75 to 60 in about a span of 5 years as a large portion of Russia's population suddenly was deemed obsolete and unproductive.\n\nWhen I say the US imposed it onto the USSR, what I mean is that the US won the Cold War. American ideas advancing privatization and neoliberalism were adopted by Russia's elite. You can fairly easily look into how much influence America neoliberal economists had on the \"shock therapy\" ideas of early 90s Russia as the country transitioned into market capitalism. American economists don't deny this, in fact some will still maintain that it was one of the greatest achievements of the American economic school.\n\nThe US isn't the origin of this, but it's certainly a dynamic that occurs here too and is quite advanced. The real origin is the capitalist system, which incentives endless growth for the private sector, and reaches across the globe and across national borders to fill every crevice that it can.",

But I can tell you're not ready for that yet.\n\nInstead I will structure my argument on your level. Let's think European = white, and the concept of man is what you believe it to be.\n\nI was not saying humans aren't inherently evil, but white men are.\n\nIt is about historical context and socialisation.\n\nEuropean colonial brutality came as a result of it's historical context. 1000 years of war, conflict and cishetero patriarchal oppression institutionalised and enforced by the Catholic church and feudalism.\n\nEuropean colonisers were not brutal because it was their natural state, but that's level of brutality had been their norm since the Romans. Was it all constant? No, but then it didn't need to be.\n\nOn to the topic of man, I look back at cishetero patriarchy under that system boys are socialised and raised to enforce the systems of oppression that they benefit from. You must be exclusively attracted to women, but only in a dehumanising, transactional and extractive way.\n\nControl your woman for you own her. Her inherent power over the future of humanity in her ability to create life must be restricted and possessed.\n\nWhite supremacist cishetero Patriarchy and abrahamic religion. That's what is inherently evil. They are undeniably systems of oppression. \n\nSystemic white supremacy and racism come as a result of class solidarity between enslaved Africans and indentured poor Europeans in the colonial Carribbean and Americas. (Reference the Barbados Slave code of 1661, the first law to codify chattel slavery and define blackness and whiteness as races).\n\nCishetero Patriarchy goes hand in hand with abrahamic religion. Am I saying patriarchy does not exist outside of abrahamic religion? Nope. But abrahamic religion and especially the Catholic church cemented the systems of cishetero patriarchy in Europe setting the groundwork for the brutality to come by dehumanising everyone. Men are dehumanised through expectations of their gender expression and what they can and can't do, but they benefit from the system so they are raised to view it as a positive. And do I even need to explain how women are dehumanised under these systems.\n\nOh also the ancient Minoans of Crete would probably be considered white today, so there were \"white\" people included on my list of civilisations.",

Or with the need for the y chromosome as being more beneficial to a group than xx only. At which point I would ask if this is even \"good and evil\" anymore, or just the way a biological script was and will likely play out again and again, as some societies and groups will always hold an unfair amount of power over others. I guess my question to you is \"at what point did this process start\"? Abrahamic (intentionally I suspect) is vague. \nLand, chattel, etc, is not just owned once. It's trading hands, producing, existing, making culture as it goes. Whatever the \"dominant\" culture is what the dominant culture is... Like it's a tautology.\n\nEspecially if you have two cultures, one who raids, and one who doesn't. Which of those wins out in the old days? \n\nAnywho. I agree with much of what you say, but it does frustrate me in places. I try to be an ally to women. Don't always succeed. \n\nI grew up in the city and mostly agree with your assessment of the average Americans views of what they even think whiteness means etc. depending on how near or far you look on the timeline, Asians are basically already considered white or will be soon. But like, Italian or Irish used to not be \"white\". \n\nSame with your Catholic take. I'm in the USA. We've been fairly anti Catholic most of my life I feel like. But I know catholic people too. \n\nI guess my point is where did this badness spring from? White supremacy as you stated wasn't really a thing until whiteness became a thing a few hundred years ago. I know for a fact there were African slaves, Jewish slaves, and likely any culture that existed that's simply no longer a thing like Babylonia or whatever (not claiming I'm a scholar in history at all!). You saying earlier cultures didn't have words for rape or war is fairly... Simplistic and almost a bit offensive in the other direction. These were advanced, thinking beings and city states. Just because they didn't run up against the same population or food issues others did by virtue of being a small island nation, doesn't mean they wouldn't have come up with \"let's checkout the mainland\" in another hundred more years. \n\nAnywho - to wrap up a little - I'm a white male with lots of privilege. I try to study these things and figure out what to do about them. But I think insisting that something works for a small nation and it will smoothly scale to any number of people is naive at best, and or creates the same things in a new mask. \n\nMy wife is Catholic actually. I often debate with her how the church has all this wealth, and how they should give that back. She argues that it does more good right now in its historic form than selling it to make parking garages or selling all their paintings to private collectors once and giving all that money to... Everyone else once. Who knows, she might even be right. \n\nAnywho. Main questions: where/when did this first spark of evil come from? What is the current solution to it *right now* if you had all the power to fix it.",

When they go to remove them they will most likely be under Iranian fire from the shore the whole time which'll slow them down.

The only \"global power\" that could be considered a true near-peer adversary is China, and they lag behind current tech of the US. They are ahead in offensive hypersonics, but even that is expected to even or US advantage in the early 2030s.\n\nIran can have whatever it wants, it's a country that spent billions on nuclear facilities that no longer exist. Their nuclear program, even if they got every bit of enriched uranium from Fordow, was set back half a decade at least by conservative estimates, most argue 7-10 years.

Don\u2019t change the fact that Iran is going to become a crater or a democracy if they don\u2019t knock their shit off. Trump already warned the civilian population to leave. We always do that before launching direct action operations. Anyone who disregards that is gonna be treated as an enemy combatant.\n\nThe whole \u201cwarfare isn\u2019t something to be proud of\u201d doesn\u2019t apply here. The talking is done. Either Iran stops developing nukes or they get obliterated.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve dealt with Iran first hand when I was in the Strait of Hormuz and Persian Gulf. They brought this shit on themselves. We really have no interest in them. Yet they constantly fuck with us. They constantly harass not only us but completely innocent shipping vessels flagged from all over the world. Just look at the Strait of Hormuz. It\u2019s international water yet Iran thinks they own it. I\u2019ve spent months doing escorts and patrolling it, simply because Iran thinks they own it and threatens civilian vessels.\n\nWe might do a lot of things backwards, but when it comes to any form of combat, we are the world\u2019s top dog.",

That involves processing hundreds if not thousands of tons of material. \n\nIran no longer has to process thousands of tons of material.  They have 400kg of 60%+ enriched uranium.   *Which means they only need to process and reprocess those 400 kg.*  And for a bomb, they only need  like...five kg.    \n\nIt can be done secretly.  There's not going to be thousands of tons of radioactive tailings.  They'll be able to keep all the byproduct on site, they'll be able to do it with a minimum of personnel, and they'll only need a smallish space. \n\nSo to answer your question, we can't know how long it will take,  we don't know what types of centrifuges are still available to them, or how many, or if they're pre-positioned.  \n\nIt's like asking how long will it take to mow a lawn...well...it depends on the lawnmower, bigger is faster. \n\nBut the important thing to understand is that at this point, the lawn is like one square foot.  You could do it with scissors.  If you've got a nice riding lawnmower, you could do it in one pass. \n\nIt's  impossible to predict what their current enrichment capabilities are and hence,  *how* long it will take, but there's so little left to do in the enrichment process that you can rest assured that no matter what their capabilities are, the answer is *soon*.  I'd say two weeks is a conservative estimate.  \n\nOnce they have the weapons grade material,  that material could be turned into a bomb in a couple days, realistically, no more than a week. \n\nIf Iran moves forward in building a nuclear weapon, and I think they will, it should take less than a month, and can be done in complete secrecy. \n\nIf I had to put a date on a test, I'd say......July 10th.\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\nEdit:  One last thing.  You asked how long it would take if they *accelerate* the program.  And that's really not the right way to think about it.   They're not *accelerating* per se.   They've had enough near weapons grade enriched uranium to unstoppably make bombs for at least a year.  It's more like they've paused, a year ago, one foot from the finish line, but *chose* not to take that final step.  Instead, they've continued to increase their stockpile of near weapons grade uranium, but they haven't enriched the good stuff to the real deal stuff. \n\nBuilding nukes is going to cause a lot of international problems for them.  And weighing the pros and cons, they decided being nuclear *capable* was better than being nuclear *armed*.\n\n\n\nAnd along comes Netanyahu who needed to save his job, and trump, who's just an idiot.....and they're basically shoving them across by changing Iran's calculus on whether to take the last step.",

The US will be force to deploy more large scale assets there to protect from what is basically teenagers flying drones.

When they launched a ddos attack on the official scientology web page, the church of scientology found and prosecuted the members responsible. They ended up facing prison time and huge fines. It was extremely unfair and extreme a response.\n\nAnyway, \"hacktivism\" remains a thing to this day, and maybe even some of the original members still participate in that community, but there is no underground A-team of hackers fighting tyranny... it makes a dramatic story, but the truth, as always, is far less romantic.

The overall plan gets talked about in a broader sense with a broader audience, but the final details are typically kept to under wraps more tightly.\n\nThink of it the same as say, a corporate merger. At the broadest levels of employees, folks might have heard a merger is happening but not know with who, what, and when. Then as you dial in on management, specific departments, CEO, and shareholders, you will find more and more detail the narrower and more important the group is to goal. CEO and board can be making specific detailed deals while rest of management is just sitting, waiting on alert knowing something is happening and they will be pulled in when needed.\n\nAnd a US false flag isn't about needing permission to bomb. That's always within Presidential power. Needing everyone to get on their side and go full scale war, however, does. We'd been bombing Osama Bin Laden since Clinton presidency. It took 9/11 to get all of US behind a full scale invasion and war in the middle east. Innocent civilian deaths that paint a common enemy which ends polarization and focuses the masses.",

The risk that they give nukes to terrorist orgs is too great.  The real question is exactly how close was Iran to building a functional nuke?  Because if they were no closer a couple days ago vs. months or a year ago then we shouldn\u2019t have engaged in the war.  Actually, we shouldn\u2019t have engaged at all unless Israel was at imminent risk of destruction (not just targeted by Iranian missiles, for which they are able to shoot down 99% of them). \n\nI seriously wonder if Trump\u2019s weak ass military parade wasn\u2019t mocked if he would have signed off on the attack.  Regardless, still an illegal move since Congress didn\u2019t sign off on the attack.

Just doing a quick ChatGPT search, here\u2019s the differences between the two roles summarized: \n\n * NCTC is about understanding and responding to existing and emerging terrorist threats from an intelligence and strategic planning perspective. It's about knowing who the threats are and how to counter them at a national level.\n * CP3 is about preventing individuals from becoming terrorists or engaging in targeted violence in the first place, through community engagement, early intervention, and addressing underlying factors. It's about building protective factors and fostering environments that are less susceptible to radicalization and violence.\nWhile their missions are complementary, one focuses on the \"hard\" intelligence and operational aspects of counterterrorism, while the other focuses on the \"soft\" prevention and community-level interventions.\n\nSo while I definitely agree is preposterous that a kid out of college could be the director of CP3 and speaks to this administration\u2019s recklessness, he isn\u2019t the director of counterterrorism like I think this thread is making it sound like he is",

Just raise my taxes and fuck the private insurance companies already. It\u2019s even possible the country would save money, and it wouldn\u2019t even hurt military enrollment; I\u2019ve never met an 18-22 year old that joined for the health benefits.\n\nI don\u2019t mind veterans getting these benefits, but it is crazy the amount of benefits available regardless of whether they\u2019ve seen combat, or not.\u00a0Lots of soft benefits too- preference for jobs, big discounts from the private sector (e.g. phone plans). If I were to do it again I\u2019d have joined after getting my bachelors, would also slap some sense into young me and told them to try harder in school, and not worry about failing. I\u2019m saying all this as someone that has had a very good career (upper middle class).\n\nWe really need to fix Social Security, Medicare, and Defense spending. It\u2019s appallingly obvious that we won\u2019t until it breaks, and the only solution will be austerity. If they were smart they would pass austerity measures that hurt the elderly (i.e. no longer contribute to GDP beyond investments), but the elderly vote in droves, and they\u2019re not smart so they\u2019ll pass austerity measures that target young people who don\u2019t vote, and won\u2019t fully realize what they\u2019re losing. I\u2019ll be elderly when this happens, and plan to vote for young people, but most of us probably won\u2019t\u2026. Even to do it right now they would need to raise taxes, and cut some benefits (e.g. eliminate the mortgage interest tax benefit). Would still be infinitely better than waiting for it to fail, which the Big Beautiful Bill will only accelerate if passed.\u00a0\n\nSorry for the rant! Are you getting a masters, or bachelors?

    "body": "In 1953, Iran had a democratically elected prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh, who committed what, in the eyes of the British Empire and the United States, was an unforgivable sin: he nationalized Iran\u2019s oil industry. \n\nFor decades, British Petroleum (then the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company) had extracted Iran\u2019s wealth, leaving the Iranian people with little to show for it. Mossadegh\u2019s move was a bid for sovereignty, dignity, and the right of a nation to control its own resources. The response from the so-called \u201cfree world\u201d was swift and brutal: a joint CIA-MI6 operation, code-named Operation Ajax, orchestrated a coup to overthrow Mossadegh, using black propaganda, bribed politicians, manufactured riots, and false flag attacks to create chaos and justify intervention. Hundreds died in the streets of Tehran as the Shah\u2014an autocratic monarch\u2014was reinstalled with American and British backing.\n\nThis single act of imperial violence shattered Iran\u2019s democracy and set the stage for everything that followed: decades of dictatorship under the authoritarian Shah, the rise of the secret police (trained and armed by the CIA), the deepening of anti-Western sentiment, and ultimately the 1979 Islamic Revolution. It\u2019s not a stretch to say that the roots of today\u2019s tensions, the cycles of violence, and the specter of war all trace back to this original sin. The aftershocks of that coup are still being felt, not only in Iran, but across the entire Middle East.\n\nYet, in the American imagination, history often starts with the hostage crisis, or with the latest missile launch, or with the rhetoric of \u201crogue states.\u201d We\u2019re taught to see Iran as an irrational enemy, a threat to \u201cour\u201d interests, never as a nation whose modern history was violently derailed by foreign powers seeking oil and geopolitical dominance. The coup became a blueprint for U.S. and British interventions around the world, fueling a legacy of distrust, blowback, and endless war.\n\nThis is not ancient history. The U.S. government only formally admitted its role in the coup in 2013, after decades of denial and the destruction of key documents. The British government\u2019s involvement was only acknowledged even more recently. The details are staggering: CIA operatives posing as communists bombing mosques to stir up religious opposition, paying mobsters to riot in the streets, and bribing editors to print fake news-long before \u201cfake news\u201d became a household phrase.\n\nSo when Americans beat the drums of war with Iran, or wonder aloud \u201cwhy do they hate us?\u201d, we have to reckon with the fact that the U.S. and U.K. destroyed Iran\u2019s best chance at democracy for the sake of oil profits and imperial power. \n\nImagine if a foreign power overthrew your government, installed a dictator, and then lectured you for decades about freedom and democracy. Imagine if, every time you tried to chart your own course, you were met with sanctions, threats, and military intervention.\n\nThe story of Iran is not unique. It\u2019s a microcosm of the broader pattern of Western interventionism: democracy is celebrated only when it aligns with the interests of empire. When democracy threatens those interests\u2014when a nation dares to control its own resources, or refuses to play by the rules of the global order\u2014it is crushed, and the consequences are borne by ordinary people for generations.\n\nThis is not about excusing the crimes or authoritarianism of the Iranian regime. It\u2019s about understanding the context that gave rise to it, and the role that Western powers played in destroying the possibility of a different, more peaceful future. It\u2019s about recognizing that the seeds of today\u2019s conflicts were planted by yesterday\u2019s coups, sanctions, and covert operations.\n\nIf we truly want peace, if we want to avoid another catastrophic war, the first step is honesty. We have to confront our own history, acknowledge the violence committed in our name, and reject the amnesia that allows us to repeat the same mistakes over and over. Until we do, every new crisis will be haunted by the ghosts of 1953\u2014and the world will continue to pay the price for our refusal to learn from the past. \n- Tim Hjersted | Films For Action",

This is based on my understanding of the issue\n\nIn short because of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which Iran signed up to. \n\nWhen the world realised just how bad nuclear weapons were, they got together and decided no more should be made. Countries that isn't have nuclear weapons and signed the treaty committed to never making and owning nuclear weapons. The countries that already owned them committed to denuclearisation.\n\nHowever, as ever there are grey areas and rhetoric. Firstly, it only gives nuclear weapons so any country is allowed to develop a peaceful nuclear program for energy and other means. Secondly, despite an initial push to decommission nuclear weapons following the Cold war, that process has pretty much stopped and I believe numbers of nuclear weapons are increasing again. \n\nSo, Iran - as a signatory - is breaking its obligation to the treaty if it is developing nuclear weapons. I'm not sure what the set up is to police it though but Israel and the US have taken it upon themselves to do so. The argument can be made that the US (and probably others) are also breaking the treaty by abandoning the decommissioning of their existing stockpile and making more nuclear weapons. \n\nThere's also the interesting option of Iran simply exiting the treaty giving them free reign to do whatever they like with nuclear weapons. That's why North Korea (who withdrew) and India (who didn't sign up to begin with) have nuclear capability but no-one is bombing them.",

Reza caused tensions to increase with Britain by exerting pressure to reform or even partially nationalize the oil industry. \n\nHowever Reza also strongly favored the Third Reich in the lead up to WWII. So much so that he renamed Persia Iran (land of the Arians). By the start of WWII Germany had become Iran\u2019s largest trading partner. \n\n**This was the actual \u201cunforgivable sin\u201d that led to destabilizing intervention in Iranian governance by foreign powers.**\n\nRussia and Britain both invaded Iran in 1941 to stop them from nationalizing the oil industry in service of the NAZI war machine. They deposed and exiled Reza Shah Pahlav and installed his son Mohammad Reza for no greater reasoning than needing a placeholder until after the War. \n\nShah Mohammad Reza then appointed a prime minister General Ali Razmara who was viewed as a more legitimate and pragmatic leader who could negotiate with the British. But before he could do much of anything he was assassinated by Islamic extremists a few months after his appointment. \n\nSo the shah then challenged Mohammad Mossadegh to take over as prime minister expecting him to fail. But with the backing of communist supporters he was able to successfully nationalize the oil industry and kick the British out causing them billions in damages from lost investments. \n\nFearing a communist revolution under Mohammad Mossadegh the US was convinced to help the British depose him and reinstall the Shah which quickly began to backfire eventually culminating in the Iranian Revolution of 1979.",

Western powers feared that Mossadegh\u2019s weakening government could fall to Soviet-aligned forces, a major risk during a time when global communism was seen as an existential threat.\n\nThough democratically elected, Mossadegh\u2019s leadership was faltering. He ruled by decree, clashed with the Shah, and faced political paralysis. His nationalization of the oil industry, while arguably justified, was done abruptly and without compensation. This violated international agreements and left Britain and the United States few options.\n\nThe coup was not purely about profit. It was also about maintaining regional stability and protecting global energy supplies in a fragile post-war economy. And while the Shah\u2019s dictatorship that followed was deeply flawed, it is overly simplistic to blame all of Iran\u2019s later troubles solely on Western intervention. Internal factors played a role as well.\n\nUltimately, the United States and the United Kingdom acted out of a mix of fear, strategic calculation, and economic interest.

This is not how these negotiations work, downstream processing does in fact NOT EVER count towards raw material manufacturing profits. The fact that the Iranians never saw bookkeeping for the profits of processing makes total sense as that is not Iran's business by a country mile what the British do with their crude oil.

Funded and trained the Contras in Nicaragua (who committed mass atrocities).\n\n2. Backed mujahideen fighters in Afghanistan (including future Taliban and al-Qaeda).\n\n3. Armed and enabled Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen, which created the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis.\n\n4. Runs global drone assassination programs that have killed thousands of civilians, including children, journalists, and aid workers with zero accountability.\n\n\nAs for Israel, they've bombed 30+ hospitals in Gaza. Starved 2 million people under siege, then blamed Hamas when children died. Murdered American and European aid workers, doctors, and UN staff, then lied about it. The Israeli's keep Gaza under conditions the ICC calls apartheid and \"inhumane acts\" against civilians.\n\n\nBut sure, Iran sending weapons to Hezbollah is the red line?\n\n\n>\u201cImperialist religious zealots\u201d\n\nThe U.S.:\n\nInvaded and occupied Iraq on false pretenses, killing over a million people. Still has hundreds of military bases around the world. Presidents regularly invoke God, divine mission, and \"chosen nation\" mythology to justify global violence.\n\n\nIsrael:\n\nFounded with a mix of settler-colonial nationalism and explicit religious claims to land. Expels, kills, or occupies Palestinians based on their ethnicity and religion. Settler groups and ultra-orthodox parties openly pursue Jewish supremacy in law and policy.\n\n\nAnd Iran? Yes, it\u2019s a theocracy. But it hasn\u2019t colonized anyone. It hasn\u2019t invaded a neighbor in modern history. And it\u2019s not exporting a global empire of bases, bombs, and boy-worshiping flags.\n\n\n> \u201cNothing wrong with keeping nukes out of their arsenal\u2026\u201d\n\nBut the U.S. has thousands of nukes. Israel has dozens (undeclared). And they\u2019re the only ones in history to actually use one. So the logic becomes:\n\n> \"We\u2019re unstable, violent, religious zealots with nukes. That\u2019s why we can\u2019t let them have one.\"\n\n\nYou don\u2019t even realize you're describing yourself.",

The Cold War is a fascinating piece of history and I encourage you to explore it beyond the tankie talking points, it's not worth my time to try to introduce some of the reality of 50 years of worldwide ideological conflict and how very understandable and human intentions manifested in events we now regret. The Iraq War shouldn't have happened as it was based on false pretenses, but the US did not plainly \"kill one million people.\" It's amusing you would bring that up here because Iran of course had an outsize share of responsibility in facilitating and encouraging the sectarian violence where the vast, vast majority of those people died. The US defeated Saddam, the power vacuum created chaos. There is responsibility for that, but to lay it all on American shoulders is to deny the agency of millions of people who participated in that aftermath and dehumanize them, but I'll grant you it's just peachy for an \"America bad\" diatribe.\n\nAs far as Israel and the trove of typical libels, time-tested propaganda and perversions of history, I can only say the modern state of Israel is a successful land-back liberation movement of one of the most interminably-oppressed minorities in recorded history and the only reason it has the borders it does today is because of Arab/Muslim decisions to refuse peaceful negotiation in favor of declaring wars of annihilation repeatedly since 1948. Palestinians would have had more land and more wealth today if their leadership would have concluded a peace agreement at any point in their history, and of course goodness knows how many more people would be alive today to enjoy it. Israel is founded as the only Jewish state in the world to something like 15 officially-Christian and 23 officially-Muslim states, but it is also founded as a democracy with universal human rights for all its citizens, including freedom of religion or non-religion. There is no apartheid in Israel. An Israeli Muslim is inherently equal to an Israeli Christian, Jew, gay, straight, what have you. If you weren't inside the borders of Israel upon its establishment or became a citizen since then, you are not an Israeli, that's completely in line with how citizenship works in every other state. Palestinians have had experiences that qualify as apartheid, but not in Israel because they are not Israeli. Jordan and Lebanon both have extensive laws restricting their rights, not least of which is the artificial preservation of their refugee status across multiple generations to forestall a natural resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict by becoming equal citizens in the land that they inhabit. If the Palestinian Authority was more interested in making the Palestinian state than in grifting off of the conflict for personal benefit, being a citizen of Palestine might have meant just as much as being a citizen of Israel does. Finally Hamas and the other terror groups, not to be forgotten, are of course fundamentally ISIS with a \"Jews first\" specialization. The ayatollahs of Iran funded them, nurtured their supremacist and hate-fueled ideology and advised them alongside dozens of other terrorist groups across the region in a modern day crusade for dominance of the Muslim (and beyond) world. And don't forget the abuse heaped upon Iranians as well; women beaten to death by the basij for their headdress, dissidents abducted, tortured and murdered, almost 50 years of needless misery and being ostracized from the wider world they used to be such a vibrant part of. Iranians as well as the whole of the Middle East deserve so much better. The Islamic Republic of Iran can get fucked 6 ways from Sunday.\n\nAnd so can you.",

This attack will set back Iran\u2019s nuclear program for sure but it doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t continue the effort and it also reinforces their belief that nuclear weapons are the only deterrent that could successfully deter future attack from the US or Israel.",

Also Iran is basically 3x the size of Iraq, and the current US military isn't big enough to invade and occupy. With modern technology they might be able to pull of the invasion, but you'd want around 1.8 million troops to successfully occupy a country the size of Iran, any less and you're pretty much guranteed to fail. Thats about 90% of US active duty, national guard, and reserves combined, so a draft would almost certainly be nescessary so that the US can still meet its other obligations. Trump is not dumb enough to do that, even if he is, congress would never go along with it.",

I also recognize that I am guided by my morals first and foremost whether or not there's a D, R or I in front of their name on the ballot. \n\nFor example, in November, I was truly unhappy with myself voting for Kamala Harris. And if I could take it back I would. Only for the sole fact that she did not deserve to be there because she was not chosen by the voters. And that goes against everything that we're supposed to stand for in our \"democracy.\" But morally (and policy wise) I couldn't vote for Trump and had to make a real attempt to keep him out of office again.\n\nAll that said, in my deep red state of KY, I have always voted independent or Democrat. But if the right Republican candidate were to take the stage and appear to care about the things that are important to me more so than their Democrat counterpart, I wouldn't hesitate to vote for them instead. \n\nSaying as of right now isn't about having an out, it's simply about recognizing that things can change a lot and being open and receptive to that potential change.",

    "body": "You are indeed dead wrong. A huge, MAJOR part of \"securing\" Iraq and Afghanistan was related to further legitimizing our military presence in that part of the world (at the cost of TRILLIONS of dollars), and in doing so making it much easier to shoehorn in private contractors to \"secure\" oil interests both in Iraq and neighboring countries. Private security firms directly benefitted sitting U.S. politicians with ties to related business assets, including the Vice President, various cabinet members and their friends and families. Additionally, our political influence increased with surrounding nation states, allowing further investments and negotiations from the United States government and private firms based on the threat of regional instability, should our forces pull out. The fact that we didn't outright seize Iraqi oil fields and that the tactical effectiveness of our policy decisions remains highly debatable is irrelevant, because our presence in the region continued long after the 2nd conflict, and it directly benefitted the financial interests of a handful of key domestic entities. Both at the great cost of U.S. tax payers and dead soldiers.\n\n\nIf you're not willing to speak about the military industrial complex like an adult human being with critical thinking skills, there's no point in having a discussion. Denying it exists in the first place is ridiculous. 3% GDP of the USA's 2024 total figures is around $860 BILLION by the way\u00a0(the Pentagon's actual budget is a little higher), more than twice the military budget under Eisenhower, adjusted for inflation. It's worth mentioning that the MIC has dramatically shifted its focus over the past ten years to AI and technological warfare, making it much more difficult to pin down the true border between the American military budget and private contracts supplying multiple business interests while using our tax dollars for R&D seed money and side investments like crypto/blockchain schemes. That's somehow worse than old-school GE, Lockheed Martin and Boeing style contracts, where budgetary discretion could be analyzed for effectiveness on the most basic Congressional level, and the value of civilian product related commercialization aspects could be more or less understood by anyone who used their products and services on a daily basis. Instead of gaining consumer level innovations that raise the average quality of life, raise wages and lower domestic manufacturing costs overall, we're funding technology that will eventually take away jobs and lower the standard of living for Americans, while stripping them of their essential privacy rights.\n\n\nOn your last claim, I don't even know where to start with how wildly stupid and incorrect it is, so I'll let Google help:\u00a0\n\n\nIncreased Surveillance Powers:\nUSA PATRIOT Act:\nThis act, passed in October 2001, significantly broadened the government's ability to monitor communications, including phone calls, emails, and internet activity, by easing restrictions on surveillance and information gathering.\u00a0\n\n\nExpanded access to records:\nThe Patriot Act allowed law enforcement and intelligence agencies to access a wider range of records held by third parties, including library records, financial records, and internet activity records, often without a warrant or probable cause.\u00a0\n\n\nReduced warrant requirements:\nIt lowered the standard for obtaining surveillance orders, particularly in cases involving foreign intelligence, making it easier for the government to conduct surveillance on individuals suspected of terrorism or espionage.\u00a0\n\n\nIncreased use of National Security Letters (NSLs):\nNSLs allowed the FBI to obtain sensitive information from businesses and individuals without a traditional warrant, and often with gag orders preventing disclosure of the request.\n\n\nExpanded Definition of \"Relevant\" Information:\nThe legal threshold for accessing Americans' sensitive information was lowered, with authorities able to collect data deemed \"relevant\" to a legitimate purpose, even without probable cause.\u00a0\n\n\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA):\nThe FISA Amendments Act of 2008 further expanded surveillance capabilities, particularly regarding communications between Americans and individuals overseas.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg. Whistleblowers have shown us again and again that various federal agencies, military and private firms are willing and able to use their congressionally approved powers to override reasonable expectations for personal privacy and mass data collection. We're still seeing the effects and unforseen consequences of that paradigm shift in situations like DOGE unilaterally accessing millions of Americans' private information via executive order, and without Congressional approval. That NEVER would have flown before 9/11, which was absolutely used as an excuse to erase an unquantifiable level of progress made by the Privacy Act of 1974. Everyone with a functioning brain understands how hopelessly futile it is to reclaim lost liberties and privacy after giving them up in trade for \"security\", no matter what our senior citizen politicians promise us (many of which were either cutting their teeth or already fully entrenched when the PATRIOT ACT was signed into law).",

Ever since, the economic differences between the US and the rest of the world meant that they could consistently siphon just about every high performer from elsewhere. \n\nThey have actively set up a \"world order\" where they are ultimately always the main beneficiary of almost anything that happens. They decide who gets to grow, who will not be allowed to grow (there's a good reason China doesn't really have a dominant place in the semiconductor market for example), or who will be set back to 0 if they misbehave.\n\nCountries that are not pro US interests will be attacked and have their governments replaced with those that are pro US interests. There is no other country that intervenes in foreign countries even remotely as much as the US (they are willing to admit to well over 80 of these instances, but there's likely more), yet we never stop hearing about it whenever any other country does anything. The US might quite literally be the only country that exists that has attacked multiple other countries because they didn't really like that they weren't capitalist enough. I'm by no means someone that isn't at least partially capitalist, but it's utterly insane to me that they did this.\n\nIt does not even really matter who is at the helm, since both their democrats and republican leaders do this in various forms.",

To be frank I\u2019m just too lazy right now to discuss on their behalf but when I was saying that they justified their comment pretty well I was referring to other comments that they made under the same parent comment were under right now. I don\u2019t actually know where there head is at well enough to defend them because I haven\u2019t had time to make a full assessment- why I said \u201cbrief assesssment\u201d.\n\nBut they referred once to China threatening US hegemony and this is true. It\u2019s a reference to hegemonic stability theory and how throughout history we usually have one superpower with hegemonic authority, and challenger states that which to upset the status quo and advance their own standing \u201con the world stage\u201d so to speak.\n\nWhen you are fighting for a spot as a world superpower, anything at all that damages your \u201cadversary\u201d, their economy, or ties up their military works to your advantage. Russias military getting fucked in Ukraine benefits the US through the lens of this theory, and if the US gets dragged into another drawn out conflict in the Middle East, or oil prices surge dramatically and cause internal strife, yada yada- it benefits China. \n\nThat\u2019s my quick take. Also what they said about China playing the long game is true, they\u2019re known to think in decades/ centuries, whereas the US and the west tend to make a lot more short term and reactionary decisions. \n\nI mean no ill will to you, I fully own how snobbish my first comment sounded",

Iran has a lot of influence in the Red Sea and the strait of Hormuz, which as a major shipping lane could potentially cause issues for the US and her oil fucking addicted economy (I\u2019m a 1st gen American).

And I believe we are very close to seeing it.  Privately, Israel/US have the backing of most of the world ex Russia/China.  And while Iran would probably like to retaliate against US assets, they will find it extremely hard to do so.\n\nIran is probably at its most isolated it has been in the last 2 decades.  Their proxies are currently all but decimated, the rest of the Arab region wants nothing to do with them or despise them to begin with, and Russia have their hands full elsewhere and really would not risk direct involvement on 2 fronts at this time.  Only China would give them direct support (weapons/intel) but don\u2019t want to too publicly back a losing side.\n\nI think Israel and the US are trying to pave the way for a regime change via military coup.\n\nA handful of observations:\n- Israel gained near full air superiority within 24-48 hrs, decimated Iran\u2019s military infrastructure and ability to strike back (Iran rocket attacks halved in a day and halved again the next).  With full air superiority over Iran, it was easy to destroy their offensive capabilities (once a rocket is launched, you know immediately where from and the Air Force can then destroy the launcher/site immediately).\n- Israel went after specifically targeted members of Iran\u2019s command structure, leaving Khamenei himself alone (don\u2019t want to make the guy a martyr, not to mention assassinating a head of state is crossing a certain line and may lead to messy/uncontrollable outcomes).\n- Israel also went after Iran\u2019s broadcasting/media centres, leaving the London-based, opposition fueled ones totally operational.\n- Having done all this, it just left the nuclear sites, requiring the bunker busters (which, only the US has).\n- Khamenei had no outs.  If he surrendered the nuclear program he might as well have ceded power, and Israel/the west would not have accepted anything other than full capitulation on that front.  Now that he has lost via force, he is weak/exposed.\n- The closure of the Hormuz is in nobody\u2019s interest, including China.  China\u2019s only interest in Iran has been economic - they have invested substantially in Iran in return for cheap oil (which Iran struggles to sell elsewhere due to sanctions).  If Iran tries to close it it will be reopened quite quickly by force - Israel has full air superiority, the US 5th fleet is just chilling nearby, and other US military assets have been shifted over to southeast Europe/Saudi on standby.\n\nThe move against this Iranian regime has been planned and in the works for at least 10+ years, and this was an extremely opportune window to execute that plan which has thus far been nearly flawless.  Longer term, the region and the world is better off with a non-nuclear, non-adversarial Iran that is reintegrated into the world stage.  Iran is a large, productive, and well-educated population steeped in culture.\n\nNow the situation in Palestine is a whole other story that is an utter humanitarian and geopolitical disaster with no possible good outcomes.\n\nAnd Russia/Ukraine I think is about to be escalated and that scares me - feels like the US/Russia have some behind the scenes quid pro quo going on (US out of Ukraine - Russia out of Iran) which destabilizes Eastern Europe and I am not sure the EU is ready/capable of guaranteeing Ukraine\u2019s security vs Russia.",

A military strike is not a declaration of war. Yes, a true declaration requires a vote in Congress. The War Powers Resolution grants the president very broad powers to conduct military operations outside of the legal definition of war as long as he a. Informs Congress within 48 hours and b. Does not commit armed forces for longer than a 60 day period without Congressional approval. The two nation states of USA and Iran are not in a legally defined war. \n\n2. This is not the U.S. being a shill of Israel. Our foreign policy has been pretty clear for decades that Iran will not be allowed to hold a nuclear weapon. Full stop. Even Trump has been clear about this opinion for more than twenty years, even when he identified as a Democrat. We are the only country on earth that possesses munitions like the GBU-57 capable of destroying facilities like Fordow. \n\n3. Anyone telling you that this will result in an Iraq-style ground invasion with thousands of American boots on the ground and another decades long nation-building enterprise is lying to fit some type of agenda or willfully ignorant. The vast majority of the Trump administration is highly isolationist/protectionist and has zero interest in that. \n\n4. Yes, there will be an increased risk to military personnel at bases throughout the Middle East and naval forces in the Strait of Hormuz. If Iran\u2019s retaliation to the assassination of Soleimani is any indication they will strike bases with the express purpose of not killing Americans to save face and claim there was a response without the inevitable massive retaliation for killing large numbers of American personnel. There is also a sizeable risk of Iranian proxy groups increasing terroristic activity in western countries including the U.S. and that threat needs to be taken extremely seriously. \n\n5. Any TikToker out there claiming that a large-scale military clash between Iran and the US results in anything other than the complete destruction of Iran\u2019s military capacity, and likely the immediate death of the Ayatollah, is objectively an idiot. In 1988, the USS Samuel B. Roberts struck an Iranian mine and the next day over half of the Iranian navy was gone. The Iranian Air Force still utilizes F4 Phantoms, a fighter jet the U.S. retired in 1996. American air power is several generations ahead.",

I\u2019m an Army Officer with specialties in Aviation, Electronic Warfare, and Foreign Intel Disclosure. \n\nFirst, Congress is playing political games with this whole \u201cwar powers\u201d BS. Trump is the commander in chief per the constitution, he can absolutely authorize the bombing of Iranian nuclear sites per US policy. He didn\u2019t commit troops, he didn\u2019t declare war, and he\u2019s done nothing the last 6 presidents haven\u2019t done. Reagan in Grenada and Panama, Clinton in Somalia and Bosnia, Bush in Afghanistan, and Obama and Biden both authorized thousands of drone strikes in numerous countries. So this is just a narrative that bears no weight. \n\nAs for Iran, they are done. Their power base in the region relied on their proxy groups. Israel has made Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis combat ineffective. Speaking of, if Trump needed justification, the Iranian backed Houthis attacked both the US and UK Navy\u2019s as well as multiple civilian cargo ships in the Red Sea. Moving on, with the fall of Assad in Syria, Iran has no allies in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, UAE, all despise Iran. Jordan actually helped shoot down Iranian missiles and drones. An Arab Nation assisting Israel against another would have been unthinkable 10 years ago but that\u2019s the reality of today. Trump contacted multiple Arab nations prior to the strike, they were fine with him hitting Irans nuclear sites because they don\u2019t want them have nuclear weapons either. Finally, the Iranian Army and population is beyond done with the Regime. However they could do nothing due to the Republican Guard. Israel has now destroyed most of Irans missiles, drones, Air Force, and decimated the top command structure of the IRG. Trump will not declare war against Iran, he won\u2019t send ground troops. This is about allowing the people to take control like what happened during the Arab Spring. Ignore all the blustering and babbling on the news. There will be no WW3.  There will be no war with Iran. Pure and simple, Iran does not have the military capability to do so. The worst thing that may come of this will be some pop up underground Iranian backed terror groups. The best, Trump and Israel accomplish something no nation has been able to do in 50 years, they topple the Ayatollah and never have to have an army set foot in Iran.",

He has arguably committed an impeachable offense that is unpopular enough that some Republicans might actually join the Democrats to impeach him and remove him from office.\n\nIran's proxies will attempt to shut down marine freight going through the Red Sea. This, combined with Iran shutting down the strait of Hormuz with naval mines, will trigger global economic recession and chaos. \n\nThis impromptu bombing of Iran, along with the successful demolition of Iran's Fordow nuclear facilities deep under that mountain, may be freaking out China right now. If Trump is willing to attack Iran like this, he may be unpredictable when it comes to defending Taiwan if China invades, and their own underground facilities probably aren't safe if we have bombs that can destroy nuclear facilities burried deep in a mountain.

I think Iran will not forgo its right to do just that.\n\nThis war will drag on - because what is basically happening is that they are trying to win a war from the air (bombs, missiles, drones), which has never worked anywhere. (Let's set aside the fact that although it is a war, both attacking nations, Israel and the US, have not declared a war).\n\nNeither Israel nor the US are able or willing to put boots on the ground.\n\nThe attacks will change nothing as far as the (perceived!) threat by Iran is concerned: at no point in time, even when IAEA had access to Iranian atomic sites, were the Israelis ready to accept any of the findings, but kept on complaining about sites the IAEA inspectors didn't have access to. The constant suspicion of \"more going on\". Somewhere else.\n\nThat is understandable, after all, the is proof of another nation completing a clandestine nuclear weapons program, and rather successfully, too. - that nation acquired nuclear weapons without the knowledge of the world, still refusing any and all inspections.\n\nWhile you can bomb any site in Iran with impunity, it seems, and use any weapon at your disposal - you can bomb sites, but you can't bomb the cause of your own paranoia.\n\nSo: did the bombs strike true? Did they reach the underground facilities? Did they destroy them, completely? How much damage was done? What happened to the enriched material? Was Iran able to move it... to that \"other hidden site\" (and there will always be \"the other hidden sight\", another \"Tora Bora\" cave complex, somewhere else)?\n\nDoes anybody think that Israel will at some point call it a day and confrm that the Iranian nuclear program has been wiped out completely?\n\nThis will be another festering wound, and Israel will keep on going. They still bomb Levannon, they still bomb Syria, they keep on bombing Yemen. No wars declared, but ongoing attacks.\n\nBecause - how to stop? Stopping would mean claiming they have \"archieved their goals\", and that will never happen. You can't stop your own obessions by bombing others.\n\nAnd what exactly do they mean when they say Iran will have to capitulate? Has there been any communication with Iran, any demands made? And if they capitulate - what then? Boots on the ground? After what the US experienced in Afghanistan and Iraq? Really? Israeli boots on the ground? Any foreign occupation of Iran? By whom, exactly?\n\nAnd if there is no occupation - what would \"capitulation\" mean? Especially if the situation remains the same: the US and Israel will never trust Iran. And even if there were controllers (of some angency, whoever) in Iran - they woulnd't trust those any further than those of the IAEA in the past.\n\nWhile the US speaks of the destruction of the Iranian nuclear weapons program (which US agencies just claimed wasn't there), Israel speaks only of slowing it down (the paranoia already talking).\n\nSo there is the strange idea of \"regime change by means of air power\", which never has worked. Germany may have collapsed at some point, but allied \"moral bombing\" didn't cause that. One could make the argument that Germans rallied around Hitler because of the bombing, rather than attempting a general uprising as envisioned by alled generals.\n\nSo - what to do without boots on the ground?\n\nThis will turn into another festering, putrid wound for years to come - at best.",

Trump has an amazing track record of ending and deescalating conflicts. \n\nI can\u2019t believe how many people in this thread are actively in support of a terrorist state having nuclear weapons. In paragraph one of their comment they\u2019ll say \u201cthis will lead to more terrorist attacks on America\u201d and in paragraph two they\u2019ll say \u201cthis is all Trump\u2019s fault.\u201d\n\nHow can you not see the problem here? The alternative scenario here was Iran gaining nuclear capabilities and almost certainly using that threat to terrorize everyone they could. Iran is one of the most distinctly evil regimes on the planet with a long track record of terrorism. \n\nIf you want to blame anyone, blame Obama for making this the choice in the first place.",

Once that happens, the dust will settles as it always does and Iran and Israel will go back to giving each other the middle finger.\n\nIf Iran and Israel shared borders there would be much more to worry about but thankfully that is not the case. \n\nNo major power is going to back Iran.

Should Israel seek Iran\u2019s unconditional capitulation, there exists a potential strategy that could achieve the psychological and infrastructural impact of nuclear warfare\u2014without the use of nuclear arms.\n\n\n\nProposed Phased Strategy:\n\n\n\nOn the first night of operations, Israel would target and eliminate roughly 10 GWh of Iran\u2019s fossil fuel-based power generation infrastructure\u2014primarily gas and oil facilities. The immediate consequence of such an action would be to effectively regress Iran's energy capabilities, and by extension, much of its economy and civil infrastructure, by approximately five years.\n\n\n\nFollowing this, a 48-hour window would be allowed for Iran to offer unconditional surrender. If no such terms are met, another 10 GWh of energy capacity would be systematically destroyed. This cycle would repeat, incrementally dismantling the country\u2019s energy backbone and compounding economic and societal regression, until surrender is achieved.\n\n\n\nStrategic Implication:\n\n\n\nThrough this methodical degradation of essential infrastructure, Israel could theoretically replicate the strategic outcome of a nuclear strike\u2014crippling the nation\u2019s functionality and will to resist\u2014without the attendant humanitarian and geopolitical fallout of actual nuclear deployment.",

This indicates that A) we are only interested in striking nuclear facilities, B) we don't want an extended conflict, and C) we aren't interested in regime change at this time. Couple possible scenarios:\n\n1. Iran doesn't retaliate against the U.S.\n2. Iran retaliates, but telegraphs to U.S. to avoid retribution\n3. Iran retaliates and kills U.S. servicemembers, which drags the U.S. into a prolonged conflict\n\nLikelihood of #3 seems low to me, simply because Iran has its hands full with Israel--which already has air superiority. While striking U.S. bases would  project strength to their supporters, any escalation would likely result in the U.S. carpet bombing the shit out of military and oil infrastructure with impunity. It would also probably guarantee regime change; even if leadership isn't decapitated by strikes, the regime couldn't survive with Iran being economically and militarily crippled.",

I'll be honest - as long as those sleeper cells don't reach him, he won't care.  He won't necessarily voice it, but deaths/casualties of Americans is a small price to pay for him to play at war.  \n\nI think Iran is going to be done playing this game of trying to build a bomb surreptitiously.

Iran gov has stated they will wipe Israel off the map if they could. They have created multiple attacks through terroirs over the years. If they get nukes, they might actually just launch them at Israel or another country or if Iran get nukes- Saudi Arabia as stated we\u2019re gonna build nukes as a deferent if iran gets them.  then it starts a cold war in the Middle East or worse. If you think about it, the move that was done Yesterday was to just strategically preemptively prevent them  from creating nukes. They bombed those sites. that was it it  to just stop their nuclear weapons programs I don\u2019t think the US will do anything else. I don\u2019t think it will escalate. Trump literally already has initiated peace offering/ talks to Iran after the bombing yesterday.

More pockets of terrorism cropping up to threaten our security so our Government can ramp up the Patriot Act with Palantir and new policies.

It's becoming increasingly clear that our democracy is really a plutocracy and neither party really cares for the citizens, at least not the ones that end up being pimped out by the highest bidders for the ballot.\n\nWe're all too far gone now as a society to band together to see the real problem and so this pathetic cycle will continue. We're dying for a third party option with legitimate staying power. We're dying for honesty. We're dying for true, central and well balanced policies that are not dictated by the extremes of either side of the current spectrum.\n\nWe just have to see it enough to believe in it.

If the FBI is targeting right-wing militias nuts, you can safely bet they've been going after Iranian terrorist cells at least as veraciously.\n\nHopefully, there's a popular uprising in Tehran and there can be a peaceful transition to democracy. The people of Tehran are very well educated and they can create a very prosperous country in short order with a little economic aid from the international community.  But it's unlikely US troops would be involved in any way except as military advisors to whatever government is formed if they're open to it.\n\nI'm not sure how likely that is and how the Iranian people are responding to the Israeli and now American airstrikes beyond the few images and video clips we see of Iranian propaganda.   If the Ayatollah remains in power, he's going to have a lot of explaining to do that he wasted all this money on proxy groups in Syria, Lebanon, and Gaza as well as a nuclear program - none of which created jobs for Iranian citizens - and all of which has been destroyed in a very humiliating fashion.",

Starting a war will just set us back and ensure our hegemonic power is finished. \n\nAlso, the problem with pushing a war with Iran is that they cannot win. Iran is significantly inferior in terms of military strength. Once we defeat them. It's not over. The Iranians are significantly different from afghans and Arabs. Despite what we see on the news, the supporters of the Ayotallah is a lot. Western propaganda shows women protesting for freedom and the youth trying to protest but you gotta understand that they are a few. When the previous Ayatollah died years ago, millions of people came to his funeral. Millions. like 10 million people. The government is extremely popular the US will have a hard time trying to establish a transitional government like they did in Iraq (even though that govt was corrupt and weak). Thousands of American lives will be lost. Far worse than in Iraq. An invasion of Iran will be catastrophic. The problem isn't taking over the airspace and securing cities etc. the issue is the guerilla warfare that will take place. Iran has a lot of mountains and caves like Afghanistan and we know how Afghanistan turned out. \n\nUltimately, as citizens we need tar and feather any politician/general pushing for a war with Iran. They most definitely have enough detail to understand that a war with Iran will end up far worse than Afghanistan. With that knowledge they Till push for a war. That is proof that they are part of the military industrial complex. Defense contractors will make billions.",

However, Iran\u2019s options for a direct military response are limited. Its conventional military capabilities are constrained, and the country is under significant economic pressure due to longstanding sanctions and internal unrest.\n\nLong-term, the prognosis may lean toward relative stability. Iran\u2019s strategic partners\u2014Russia and China\u2014have little interest in escalating the conflict. Russia, facing its own military depletion due to the war in Ukraine, has relied on Iranian drones rather than offering substantial support in return. China continues to purchase Iranian oil at discounted, sanction-evading prices but has shown no willingness to back Iran militarily or diplomatically in any significant way. Both Russia and China have historically opposed a nuclear-armed Iran, further limiting Tehran\u2019s leverage.\n\nIf Iran\u2019s leadership calculates that full-scale retaliation could provoke regime-threatening consequences, it may opt for symbolic or limited responses while focusing on preserving its internal stability and regional influence via proxies. While the situation remains volatile, a broader regional war is not inevitable, particularly if international actors continue to push for de-escalation",

But if Iran can be flipped, it\u2019s a whole new world. I suspect the US and Israel will find a reason to kill Khamenei install Pahlavi, and provide support to the new government.  That said, I don\u2019t think Trump has the stomach for it.  I think the war lasts two weeks, khamenei is killed leaving chaos and a power vacuum.  Trump congratulates himself and walks away.

Most of the world has serious issues with the Iranian regime, particularly the rest of the Middle East and Europe. While I'm not the biggest Trump fan, I think he definitely got it right this time. Whether the United States has acknowledged it publicly or not, the Iranian regime has been at war with the United States since 1979 when they took 52 Americans hostage and held them for 444 days. Since then it's been a never ending series of Iranian backed attacks.... the 1983 Iranian backed Beirut bombing that killed 241 service members, and so on. To not take the opportunity presented to destroy the nuclear program of a regime that has been calling the United States \"Big Satan\" and whose national motto for nearly half a century has been \"Death to America\" would have been a huge missed opportunity. Will Iran try to mine and shut down the Strait of Hormuz? Maybe. If they do successfully do that, will it last more than a few days? Probably not. Will Russia and China and the DPRK be upset and sabre rattle? Maybe. Honestly I don't think there will be any long lasting negative consequences and most likely way more upside than down",

That may sound weird, \u201cpeacefully.\u201d That means for the purposes of use with nuclear power plants. Since Russia is their ally, Russia will defend them at the UN, but China won\u2019t because China relies super heavily off of the Straight of Hormuz being open. Ultimately, we might see this stunt go on for a little while, but Iran will stop their bullshit in the Straight of Hormuz in about 2-3 weeks or sooner. You\u2019ll see some slight oil price spikes for a moment but I think we will see normal prices again after about 1 month.\n\nIran is heavily on the defensive right now. They are in no position to attack the US aside from maybe bombing an embassy somewhere. They don\u2019t have the capability or resources to pull anything in the states. Besides, they are in a game right now of playing the victim. The way they gain ground is the turn the UN against the US, so that\u2019s their play right now. Hard to say if that will work, likely not. The US, despite their aggressive trade behavior lately, is an economy that many other countries are invested in and rely on, and Trump seems trigger happy with calling any country he wants a pariah state that deserves more tariffs.

The more effective it is, the faster they lose influence.\n\nThe invasion and war in Iraq was based off lies then any and all terrorist attacks were used to justify occupation and control. As weird as it is, the US military isn't the enemy, it's political leaders. \n\nYou can work with the US military especially US officers. Documentation and record, abiding by codes of conduct and behavior are core values that Officers get promoted for. \n\nIt's likely we'll see Republicans try again to build a mercenary army to do a bunch of illegal bs that again makes more problems than they solve. This happened with Blackwater and it keeps happening. Because they are private, you can't trust them. So we'll watch them make a bigger political mess as they represent the States and destroy trust.\n\nThis will be a golden opportunity for every country in the region to unify against Israel and anyone supporting them. \n\nEven if it's proved Iran had nukes, Trump was the one that ended the deal and created this mess of distrust and problems.

Iran has said and I don't blame them, that they will fight to the end, they will retaliate. I believe it. Nations as Pakistan, China, Russia, N Korea have already delivered supplies, and have some kind of partnership with the nation not to mention others. They have seen what we've done probably as crossing a red line for them it shows just how far we will go, plus most recently we provided intel and support for Ukraine's strike deep into Russia. I understand a lot of people say oh they wont do anything, they can't. People need to understand we're one country with decreased amount of allies, and facing an increased threat everyday. Most Americans don't want anymore wars, they just want to live in peace. \n\nI believe this will spiral out of control, Iran and its allies will hit US bases in the region, US vessels will come under attack, the straight of Hormuz will probably be shut down increasing inflation by crazy amounts. I don't think everything will happen over night and maybe not even this week. It will be one attack after another, and most likely will lead to a 3rd world war. I don't envision WW3 to be this year, its possible but I believe it will take at least a year to fully spin out of control to that point. But our own power grid in the US is an easy target, its old, in major need of over haul and replacing, if its attacked it will take months or longer to repair, replace - where ever the attacks are in those areas. \n\nWithout a power grid there is no fridges, freezers, stores, no bank access, no wifi, no fuel, hospitals only have x amount of back up generator power. Without income, and power there will be mass rioting and unrest, theft. I'm not a the end is near kind of guy, or the apocalypse is coming, I believe we're not important just one world in this massive galaxy, out of millions of other galaxies but we've definitely gone to far here. Iran didn't have any nukes, Israel has cried wolf for 30+ years, they didn't F around and find out. Trump took away the agreement years ago because Obama made it, so none of this makes any sense. No time was even given to Iran, both the US and Israel strikes illegally. There was no hard cut off like hey lets sit down, see what we can work on, compromise, to co exist. This is all such a sad and stressful situation, we need cooler heads, more intelligent thought into future actions. I'm definitely not looking forward to how this affects the economy.",

Russia is unlikely to view a pattern of attacking its allies favourably and it seems logical that it may then move military resources away from Ukraine to Iran to prevent the collapse in Iran. That\u2019s obviously not great for them but the alternative is that they get locked out of the Middle East and regimes more friendly to the US displace them which is also a terrible outcome. All that is to say that they may choose to respond in kind with an attack on a US ally and then it\u2019s basically the Cold War again with a series of proxy wars around the world as an alternative to direct conflict between super powers.",
